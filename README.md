## **DISCLAIMERS**

###    Donâ€™t be a dick!
What does this mean? Simple; Don't act, smell, or look like a cunt!
&nbsp;

What do I mean by this you may ask? Simple as well! Here's the list:

* Don't dress like a dick.
* Don't act like a dick.
* **Take a fucking shower.**
* Shave your goddamn neckbeard.
* **Be nice to people.**
* Clean up your shit if you're asked to.
* **DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE ANYTHING PERMANENT! THAT'S V A N D A L I S M!**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**If** you do get stopped by transit cops or any authority figure whatsoever, please be nice to them. **AND DON'T RUN!** They're just doing their jobs, and if you are a decent human being, they likely will not do anything to you. They may ask you to remove your sticker, or destroy your spares. If they do ask you to do this, **DO IT!**

And hey, while you're at it, why not give the cops a sticker too and invite them. How fucking top of a meme would that be if they joined? Remember, we're in it for the fun, and we're in it for the experiment of seeing how well these codes spread. Not to take down the man or whatever dumb shit people might assume this is about!

Because, at the end of the day, we're a jolly band of shitposters trying to make more friends! Not a bunch of juvenile delinquents who've got a bone to pick with the transit system!

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### What does permanent mean, you may ask? Yet again, very simple;
Permanent is defined as anything that isn't easily removed without damage to whatever surface it's attached to. No shit.

&nbsp;

  A list of things that are considered permanent:
  * Stickers that are not easily removed.
  * Papers that are duct taped on (fuck you).
  * Anything involving glue. Especially gorilla glue (ooh ooh ah ah).
  * **Anything at all involving any kind of paint whatsoever.**
  * Anything involving scratches or cuts in a surface.

  &nbsp;

  Tl;dr, **NOTHING FUCKING PERMANENT.**

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;

## Supplies Needed

&nbsp;

Alright, still in? Great! The supplies needed are very simple. Here's the list:

* Working inkjet printer (Preferably with color ink).
* A roll of scotch tape.
* Something to put them in without bending or crumpling the tags, that's also easily accessible.
* Something to cut the tags out with. (I like scissors for this, but if you don't have a steady hand, use an exacto knife or something)
* The files provided in this git repo.
* A working computer (If you want to make your own modifications), or a phone (If you just want to print the provided tag), either works.
* GIMP (Yet again, only if you want to modify the template)

&nbsp;

And that's it. Get printing and get out there! Well... I'll add one caveat, and that's to use your own discresion on what you print these tags on. You can use sticker paper if you want, but we don't condone this. If you chose to use sticker paper, be warned, that you **CAN** and likely **WILL** get in trouble for this. If you're intending to put these on things that are already smattered with stickers and other graffiti, you'll probably be alright. But if you're an **ASSHOLE** and stick these on busses or anything not already assraped by the general public. **You're a douchebag, we don't condone your actions, and you will likely be charged with vandalism. And we will ban you immediately if we find out.**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## How to Print

Also very simple. I'm tempted to say, 'just print it retard', but I GUESS it's a little more complicated than that. So here:

* Download this git. Either hit it up with a git clone, or click download as zip. Whatever you want fam.
* Select your paper size, I've included several pre tiled templates for common paper sizes. The one's I've tested myself or have had other people, are marked with a 'working' tag in the filename.
* Print it out, in full color if all possible.
* Cut it out as carefully as you can, do not damage the code itself **AT ALL** or the sticker will not work.
* Store in a safe, dry pocket. Preferably one that wont crumple or crease the paper.

Simple, eh? Get rolling.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## How to Avoid Trouble

Simple. Dont dress or act like a G.I Joke, and you'll be fine. This isn't mission impossible, you're essentially littering at worst. Dont treat it as super spy LARP.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## How to Customize the Template

This is actually very easy. Provided is a GIMP project file with all of the elements you need seperated as layers. Want a new background image? Replace the background image layer. Want a new link? Replace the link layer (VCR Font is provided in the git). Want a new code. Replace the code layer.

If you've ever edited an image with GIMP, you already know what to do.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## How to Create Your Own Codes

You'll need to do this if you want to submit yourself for the leaderboard, if that ever becomes a thing. It's quite easy. Pretty much any QR creator will work. I've actually forgotten the one I used. But it is nice to have one that lets you use a transparent background, if you can find a generator that does.

Here's a step by step to generating a code complete with unique invite link that can be used to join the leaderboard:
* First generate a Discord invite link, preferablly landing in oblivion_access. Make sure to save it, you'll need it's ID later for tracking purposes.
* Take that link, and put it into Grabify to generate a tracking link. This will help you track your ratio of scans to actual joins, as this simply logs connection and browser information when it loads. You'll probably want to make yourself an account on Grabify as well, or save the tracking code for later use.
* Take that grabify link you generated, and slam it into the bit.ly link shortener. It looks better. Trust me.
* Pop that final link into your QR generator, and into the link layer of your tag, if you're using it.

And Bob's probably not your fucking uncle! But at least you've got a custom tag now, so that's something. Informaton about how to submit this to the leaderboard will go here, if we ever get around to doing that.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## How to Track Your Custom Tags

The reason you generated that Grabify link, is so you can at least track your **scans**. Not your actual **join** stats. Currently, Discord only allows server administrators to view invite link usage stats. So you're kinda SOL on that one on your own.

If you'd like to know your link stats, hit me up on Discord. My username is Jvk1166z, duh. And if you send me the ID of your invite link, I'd be happy to relay the numbers to you!

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## How to Submit Tags to The Leaderboard

This is a WIP, there currently is no leaderboard to speak of. And there may never be one. This is simply a placeholder section.

Basically this is currently up to wether or not I'm willing to actually set up a system for it. As I'm sure it'd be my responsability, as nobody else would want to deal with it. And I'm pretty fuckin' lazy...

## Footnotes

This is just a project for fun. If you have any questions or concerns **PLEASE CONTACT US!**. Here are some people you can contact if you've got any issues or questions for us. This list is in the direct order of involvement with the project, so please start from the top and work your way down. Here's the list, these are Discord usernames by the way if you didn't already guess: 

1. Jvk1166z#8008: This is my project, so by default I'm obviously in charge of keeping it from going to shit. Please contact me first if you have any questions, as I'll be able to best help you with that. If you have any **concerns** about this project, plesae contact me and #2 simultaneously, both of us need to know.
1. Uncle#420: Owner of the server. Contact him **immediately** if there are any **concerns**. I've worked directly with him for the construction of this operation, so he'll probably know the answers to any other questions you have. But always check with me first for those, as not to waste his time.

That's the two of us who are directly involved with this project at a core level. Here are the contacts of other admins of the server, if for some reason we cant be reached immediately. They wont know much in detail about the project itself, but if you urgently need to contact us with a **concern**, get in touch with one of them, and they'll help you get it to the right people. Here's the list: 

2. Larry Lesbiano#1632: He's not core to the construction of the operation. But he's been around for more of it than any of the other admins. So he should be your first contact if you cant get Uncle or I.
2. ExLegendaryHero#4167
2. Salival01#1984
2. Threeninesix#9372
2. Zdonick#5261
2. nani#1549
2. Nac#4753
2. d0ngus#5299

All of this information is available in the text channel #oblivion_access as well, should you want to view it there. 

If you're wondering what is defined as a **concern** here it is:

* A **concern** is anything involving the operation itself as a whole. This can be simply asking if something you're considering doing is okay with us. But more importantly, if you're a building owner or someone of authority, and you want us to stop. Or you want to report someone for being a piece of shit. We need to know immediately, so we can take action. Though we will ask you to provide some proof of authority, or in the case of reporting someone of unsavory behavior, proof.
