## **DISCLAIMERS**

###	Dont be a dick!
What does this mean? Simple; Dont act, smell, or look like a cunt!!

What do I mean by this you may ask? Simple as well! Here's the list:

* Dont dress like a dick.
* Dont act like a dick.
* Take a fucking shower.
* Shave your goddamn neckbeard!
* Be nice to people.
* And clean up your shit if you're asked to!!


**If** you do get stopped by transit cops or whatever, please be nice to them! **AND DONT RUN!!!** They're just doing their jobs, and if you are a decent human being, they likely will not do anything to you. They may ask you to remove your sticker, or remove your spares. If they ask you to do this, **DO IT!**

And hey, while you're at it, why not give the cops a sicker too and invite them! How fucking top of a meme would that be if they joined! Remember, we're in it for the fun, and wer're in it for the experiment of seeing how well these codes spread. Not to take down the man or whatever!
