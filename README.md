## **DISCLAIMERS**

###    Donâ€™t be a dick!
What does this mean? Simple; Don't act, smell, or look like a cunt!
&nbsp;

What do I mean by this you may ask? Simple as well! Here's the list:

* Don't dress like a dick.
* Don't act like a dick.
* **Take a fucking shower.**
* Shave your goddamn neckbeard.
* **Be nice to people.**
* Clean up your shit if you're asked to.
* **DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE ANYTHING PERMANENT! THAT'S V A N D A L I S M!**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**If** you do get stopped by transit cops or any authority figure whatsoever, please be nice to them. **AND DON'T RUN!** They're just doing their jobs, and if you are a decent human being, they likely will not do anything to you. They may ask you to remove your sticker, or destroy your spares. If they do ask you to do this, **DO IT!**

And hey, while you're at it, why not give the cops a sticker too and invite them. How fucking top of a meme would that be if they joined? Remember, we're in it for the fun, and we're in it for the experiment of seeing how well these codes spread. Not to take down the man or whatever dumb shit people might assume this is about!

Because, at the end of the day, we're a jolly band of shitposters trying to make more friends! Not a bunch of juvenile delinquents who've got a bone to pick with the transit system!

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### What does permanent mean, you may ask? Yet again, very simple;
Permanent is defined as anything that isn't easily removed without damage to whatever surface it's attached to. No shit.

&nbsp;

  A list of things that are considered permanent:
  * Stickers that are not easily removed.
  * Papers that are duct taped on (fuck you).
  * Anything involving glue. Especially gorilla glue (ooh ooh ah ah).
  * **Anything at all involving any kind of paint whatsoever.**
  * Anything involving scratches or cuts in a surface.

  &nbsp;

  Tl;dr, **NOTHING FUCKING PERMANENT.**

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;

## Supplies Needed

&nbsp;

Alright, still in? Great! The supplies needed are very simple. Here's the list:

* Working inkjet printer (Preferably with color ink).
* A roll of scotch tape.
* Something to put them in without bending or crumpling the tags, that's also easily accessible.
* Something to cut the tags out with. (I like scissors for this, but if you don't have a steady hand, use an exacto knife or something)
* The files provided in this git repo.
* A working computer (If you want to make your own modifications), or a phone (If you just want to print the provided tag), either works.
* GIMP (Yet again, only if you want to modify the template)

&nbsp;

And that's it. Get printing and get out there! Well... I'll add one caveat, and that's to use your own discresion on what you print these tags on. You can use sticker paper if you want, but we don't condone this. If you chose to use sticker paper, be warned, that you **CAN** and likely **WILL** get in trouble for this. If you're intending to put these on things that are already smattered with stickers and other graffiti, you'll probably be alright. But if you're an **ASSHOLE** and stick these on busses or anything not already assraped by the general public. **You're an asshole, we don't condone your actions, and you will likely be charged with vandalism. And we will ban you.**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## How to Print

Also very simple. I'm tempted to say, 'just print it retard', but I GUESS it's a little more complicated than that. So here:

* Download this git. Either hit it up with a git clone, or click download as zip. Whatever you want fam.
* Select your paper size, I've included several pre tiled templates for common paper sizes. The one's I've tested myself or have had other people, are marked with a 'working' tag in the filename.
* Print it out, in full color if all possible.
* Cut it out as carefully as you can, do not damage the code itself **AT ALL** or the sticker will not work.
* Store in a safe, dry pocket. Preferably one that wont crumple or crease the paper.

Simple, eh? Get rolling.

## How to Stick Without Getting Busted

While we aren't out to cause trouble, technically this is considered littering. So while it's not like you're robbing a Seven Eleven at gunpoint, it's best to try to avoid obvious detection. Most regular people wont shit half a fuck about whatever you're up to, but try not to do it right in front of a Karen. **OBVIOUSLY** use common sense, and don't do this directly infront of anyone with authority. If a transit cop or someone else who gets paid enough to care sees you, they likely will stop you and ask you to take it down. If this happens, **YOU DO IT**. And you do it politely.

&nbsp;

Some tips I can give you for avoiding detection are pretty simple and common sense, but I'll list them anyways. Here they are: 

* Dont tape your stuff up directly in front of people. This is really not important most of the time, as nobody cares. But it never hurts to be more secure if you have the option.
* Dont act suspicious. If you'd ditch your gum wrapper on the street, you're essentially doing the same thing here. Dont act like it's anything more than that.
* Dont do it infront of authority figures. Idiot.

&nbsp;

And I'll reiterate here, just in case you went tl;dr on me. **WE DO NOT CONDONE V A N D A L I S M.** We aren't doing anything wrong here, dont act like you are. Just use common sense, thats all. If you wanna pretend to be G.I Joe, that's on you. Have fun. It's not our problem if you end up screwing yourself over by acting like a jackass.
